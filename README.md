# My project for learning vulkan

As the title says, this is a little project I'm starting for myself to better my understanding of the vulkan graphics api.

## Learning material

### Vulkan Specification
The code I'm writing is coming from thoroughly reading the vulkan specification.

### Vulkan Tutorial
This is the very famous vulkan tutorial that everyone uses. I'm using the code examples as a loose guideline. (Note this is for C++)
